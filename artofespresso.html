    <h1>The Art of Espresso</h1>
    <p><b>Role</b>: UX Designer</p>
    <p><b>Time</b>: 2 months</p>
    <p><b>Tools</b>: Balsamiq, Sketch, Invision</p>
    <p><b>Deliverables</b>: Creative Brief, Competitive Analysis, Website</p>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>The Art of Espresso is a humble coffee cart located on a small hill near the center of UC San Diego. Known for it’s welcoming atmosphere and direct trade coffee, it has become a staple for students and faculty alike.<br><br>

      I worked in a team of 3 to redesign the business’ website. We guided our client through a comprehensive research and design process.</p>

    <h2>Understanding our users</h2>
    <p>We needed to learn about the needs of the business and the customers. We started by gathering requirements from our client - they needed a menu for regular items and for catering, no $$$ on the menus to account for fluctuating prices, and we constrained to designing for the existing brand.
      <br><br>
      We then interviewed a total of 12 coffee drinkers consisting of students and faculty. These are the insights we gained from our conservations with them – </p>
    <p><b>A place to meet</b><br>Many people had trouble finding the cart at first. Copy and imagery needed to effectively communicate the location of the cart.</p><br>
    <p><b>Customer on the go</b><br>A large majority of people we interviewed drank their coffee on the go. If they were to visit the site, it needed to be responsive.</p><br>
    <p><b>Attracting newcomers</b><br>Some people had never even been to the Art of Espresso. Showing them the old website did not provide a good first impression.</p>

    <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
    <p>A thorough competitive analysis helped us generate ideas on how to solve some issues we were facing. <b>Namely, how might we design a website that hosts a large amount of information like food and drink menus?</b><p><br>

    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    <p>We then created desktop wireframes using Balsamiq. <b>We decided to implement a card-based UI pattern because it improves scannability of the site by organizing information into chunks of content.</b> Furthermore, cards are visually appealing and are easily adaptable to multiple screen sizes.<p>

    <h2>Visual design</h2>
    <p>The site needed to evoke a modern aesthetic without sacrificing the “mom and pop” appeal that the cart was known for. We took visual inspiration from the earthy tones surroundignt the cart. I worked on developing a styleguide that complemented the imagery my partner took.<p><br>

    <h2>Mobile prototype</h2>
    <p>I made an initial prototype of the mobile version of the site using Sketch and Invision. Mobile design has the most limitations, primarily screen-size and bandwidth, which was a useful design constraint because it helped us hone in on what matters most, <b>content</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Design decisions</p>
    <p>1. Using hamburger menu design pattern rather than the word "Menu" to avoid confusion with food and drink menu</p>
    <p>2. The banner message updates depending on the time of day. At any given moment, users can check the site to see if the Art of Espresso is open.</p>
    <p>3. Direct link to page with more info for users seeking to learn more operational information</p>
    <p>4. A collapsible menu helps sort out the 50+ items on the food and drink menu. This helps prevent cognitive overload for users.</p>
    <p>5. Click to expand and collapse</p>

    <h2>Final design and reflection</h2>
    <p>Our final deliverable is a responsive website that stays true to the Art of Espresso’s brand, while adressing client and user needs.
    <br><br>
    I learned a lot from this project, most notably – how to communicate with a client, designing for mobile, and how to work with developers effectively. Shout out to Kami and Vincent for being amazing teammates!
