      </div>
      <p>People need to gather a lot of information before they can confidently request time off from work. However, the time off experience was disjointed and provided minimal utility.<br></p>

        <h4>Leveraging past research to delve deeper</h4>
      </div>
      <p>When I joined in 2017, the team was in the midst of introducing a new design system and improving parity across the mobile and web products. Heaps of research had been conducted to ensure that these design changes were customer-centric. <br><br>By leveraging research studies from these efforts, we identified problems with the &quot;request time off&quot; feature of Workday.<br><br>I supplemented these studies by conducting product audits, competitive analyses, and user interviews.<br></p>
      <p><br>Key insights included –<br><br>1. New hires were confused about how time off plans differed<br><br>2. People that work in collaborative environments value knowing when their teammates will be out of the office.<br><br>3. People often manage multiple calendars and take them into consideration when requesting time off from work.<br></p>

        <h4>Collaborative ideation</h4>
      </div>
      <p>I led a design jam with diverse stakeholders to ideate ways of improving the platform based on the research findings we had compiled. <br><br>These “how might we questions” drove our design thinking.<br><br>1. How might we inform people of important changes to their time off plans?<br><br>2. How might we better communicate time off balances?<br><br>3. How might we inform people when their teammates are out of the office?<br></p>
