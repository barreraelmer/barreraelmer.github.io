              <h2>Reimagining a core part of the &quot;request time-off&quot; flow</h2>
              <p>As an intern on the Payroll, Time Tracking and Absence team, I redesigned a core. With the support of my team, I was able to take lead on the project from research to tested prototype. The end result was three feature proposals that were informed by customer research.</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <p>Due to NDA, I have omitted certain portions of my process. Contact me if you&#x27;d like a deep dive into this project.</p>

              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>During early research sessions we learned that recent graduates had difficulty finding information that would allow them to confidently request time off from work. The current flow on mobile was functional, but lacked the utility that the desktop version had. Mobile users had trouble –</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Understanding when their time off request was approved.</li>
                <li>Understanding the difference between their time off plans.</li>
                <li>Discovering dates that were preferable to take time off from work.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>There were also minor issues of parity across our web and mobile products. With a new <a href="https://design.workday.com/">design system</a> on the way, this was a prime opportunity to overhaul core parts of the mobile time off flow. </p>
              <p>‍</p>

              <h2>Research</h2>
              <p>I conducted product audits, competitive analyses, stakeholder and customer interviews to further understand the nature of taking time off from work. This work helped us understand the user workflow.</p>
              <p>‍</p>

              <p>‍</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <p>Later, my team was able to align on which user scenarios to design for –</p>
              <ol start="1">
                <li>As an employee, I need to know if my request has been approved, so I can confidently take the time off from work.</li>
                <li>As a first time user, I need to know how my time off plans work, so I can use the appropriate one.</li>
                <li>As an employee considering taking time off, I need to know when my teammates will be out of office. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>‍</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <p>‍</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div id="four">
            <div id="3" class="proj-rich-text w-richtext">
              <h2>Ideation</h2>
              <p>Once the team had a shared understanding of the problem, current experience, and its primary users, I organized a collaborative ideation session. The session was interdisciplinary – we invited PMs, Content Strategists, Researchers and Designers from adjacent teams. By borrowing methods from the Google Ventures Design Sprint process, we were able to quickly ideate solutions in one afternoon.</p>
              <p>‍</p>

              </figure>
              <p>‍</p>
              <p>After dot voting on the most promising ideas, I recruited five new hires at Workday to discuss the validity of our initial bets. We then settled on fleshing out the following components for mobile – Pending Request View, Time Off Plans View, Team Time Off Status.</p>
              <p>‍</p>

            <div class="proj-rich-text w-richtext">
              <h2>Designing for reassurance</h2>
              <p>In the current mobile experience, there was no way to check the status of a submitted request. Once a person had submitted a time off request, they were only informed on approval through their Workday inbox. This was an issue for a growing percentage of our mobile dependent user base. Our solution was to add a pending request view in the time off product area to alleviate this problem.</p>
              <figure style="max-width:2560pxpx" id="w-node-9aea05a1cafa-95f5691d" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">

              <p>‍</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>Designing for clarity</h2>
              <p>Research showed that people wanted to know how their total available hours were distributed across time off plans. Knowing that you have 48 hours available is not useful if half of those hours can only be approved for medical emergencies. To resolve this, I designed a view that breaks down each plan and its available hours. </p>
              <figure style="max-width:2560pxpx" id="w-node-aac6266909f9-95f5691d" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">

              </figure>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>Designing Team Time Off</h2>
              <p>My initial bet was a holistic view of teammates out of office would be useful for people to know when requesting time off. Design explorations ranged from calendar views to simple list views located in the same screen as past designs – it would be a dashboard of sorts.</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <figure style="max-width:2560px" id="w-node-cf0f8101b4b4-95f5691d" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                <div><img src="images/team-timeoff.png" alt=""></div>
                <figcaption>Wireframe explorations</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>‍</p>
              <p>Ultimately, I felt that the calendar view would be most useful because it provides a holistic view and follows a familiar design pattern. I prototyped it with motion to better communicate the idea.</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                <div><img src="images/wd-calendar-trimmed-1.gif" width="262" alt=""></div>
              </figure>
              <p>‍</p>
              <p>I reevaluated my design decision after a round of ad-hoc user testing. People thought they could select dates to request time off from this calendar view, when in reality they needed to click the &quot;Request time off&quot; CTA to enter that flow. After consulting with my design mentor we decided to take a different approach and contextualize the information within the actual request time off flow.</p>
