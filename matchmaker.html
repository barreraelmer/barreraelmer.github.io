    <h2>My Role</h2>

    <p>I collaborated with SAP designers on behalf of the design lab to conceptualize a platform that matches educators and classes to real world projects. I conducted competitive analysis, made wireframes, and designed an interactive storyboard prototype to communicate the idea behind the Matchmaker.</p>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>Since 2015, SAP's design team has been reseraching the education space, which ultimately led them to partner with the Design Lab. After conducting extensive research at 6 different colleges and with over 20 professors, SAP came to the following fundamental insight:</p>

    <h2 class="highlight">"Students are coming out of university unprepared for the challenges of the workforce"</h2>
    <br><br><br>

    <p>This journey map depicts the typical college experience:
    <br><br>
    <img class="content-img" src="img/mm/studentjourneymap.png"></img>
    <br><br>
    Curious about what was currently being done to address this problem, we conducted a competitive analysis:
    <br><br>
    <img class="content-img" src="img/mm/mmca.png"></img>
    </p>
    <h2>
    We learned that:</h2>
    <p>
    1. Project-based courses are crucial for applying knowledge to labor, however, they are <b>confined to the university bubble.</b>
    <br><br>
    2. The emergence of hackathons and industry-focused clubs show that students are aware of the issue, however, this is not enough to solve it.
    <br><br>
    3. Schools that host capstone courses, where students can work on corporate sponsored projects have an advantage, however, these programs are limited.
    </p>

    <h2>Reframing the problem and rapidly prototyping ideas</h2>
    <img class="content-img" src="img/mm/rapid.jpg"></img>
    <br><br>
    <p> We wondered, what's stopping educators from introducing real-world projects into their classrooms? So, we quickly storyboarded this concept and presented it to professors to get their input.
    <br><br>
    These are the main insights we got:
    </p>
    <h2 class="highlight">Working with industry is tricky; educators don't want their students to be seen as free labor <br><br>
    Successful engagements with industry involve alumni that the educators already trust
    <br><br>
    To make it work, educators would need freedom in reframing the "industry problem" into a "teaching problem" as well
    </h2>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>With this in mind, we developed our solution.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Matchmaker is a system that matches Educators and classes with real-world problems that have appropriate flexibility and commitment. The goal is to encourage Educators to adopt these projects for their students, resulting in students coming out better prepared for the real-world.
    <br><br>
    We ended up prototyping it in the form of a physical storyboard with an interactive portion. Ultimately, we pitched the idea at a workshop for design thinking educators and got valuable feedback on how to improve it. More on that soon, but in the meantime â€“<br><br>
